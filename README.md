## Warning: Educational Project. Work in Progress

Do not use this CLI in production or serious research. It's still at quite an early stage, and thus is subject to hidden bugs and changes of functionalities. Error reporting is primitive.

There are numerous fantastic open-source libraries and CLIs with capability far beyond mine, such as [Sage](https://www.sagemath.org/).

## Brief Introduction

The CLI is an calculator for arithmetic operations on some common algebraic objects. Its primary aim is to compute BÃ©zout's identity for integers, Gaussian integers, polynomials over rationals, and polynomials over a prime finite field. Minor features like adding and multiplying are added along the way. I hope this tiny program can take you through a very brief journey in the world of elementary number theory.
